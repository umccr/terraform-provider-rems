# remsclient

The `remsclient` folder is a package for an autogenerated HTTP/REST client for REMS.

## Generation

Currently generated with openapi-generator, but could be anything.

```
openapi-generator generate -i https://rems-test.2.rahtiapp.fi/swagger.json -g go
```

Had to then rename the package to remsclient.

Also, had to hand correct some errors.

Need a better process.
